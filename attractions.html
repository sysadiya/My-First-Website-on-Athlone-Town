            <h2>The History of Athlone castle</h2>
            <div class="history">
            <p>
            Over the years Athlone castle has been used for many purposes. The nucleus of Anglo-Norman settlement, a stronghold for rival local families the Dillons and the O`Kelly’s, the seat of the Court of Claims; the residence of the President of Connaught and the Jacobite stronghold during the sieges of Athlone. After the siege of Athlone, it was turned into the new military barrack complex. It remained like that for 300 years. In 1967 The Old Athlone Society established a museum in the castle with a range of exhibits relating to Athlone. In 1969 when the military left the castle it was handed over to the Office of Public Works (OPW).
            In 1991 Athlone Town Council made a major investment in the castle creating a Visitor centre. A total of 4.3 million euros was invested into the new facility by Fáilte Ireland and Athlone Town Council. It was officially opened by Michael Ring T.D. on Tuesday 26th February 2012.

            <h2>The Luan Gallery</h2>
    <div class="history">
    <p>
            Stroll across the bridge in Athlone and nestling on the right hand bank you’ll find the stunning Luan Gallery. A showcase for the most interesting artists from the midlands, Ireland and abroad, the building itself is a modern work of art in its own right. With floor to ceiling windows offering uninterrupted views across the majestic Shannon water, it’s a space that gives the work real room to breath.
            There’s always an eclectic and balanced mix of media on display from painting to sculpture to textiles. Entry is completely free and if you’d like a one on one tour, that’s free too. All you have to do is ask. What’s more the collection on display changes every two months so there’s always something new to see. A feast for the eyes, it’s a fantastic way to spend some time.
