<p>    
        Although Athlone's weather isnt the best it follows along with the usual weather in Ireland. There 
        is rarely any serious heatwaves or floods and the storms that do happen occasionally are never extremely 
        desctructive. Unlike othere areas of Ireland there is no issue of houses getting knowcked down during storms
        or entire towns getting flooded.
